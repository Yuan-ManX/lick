How to contribute to LiCK
=========================

Thank you in advance for contributing to LiCK!

It would be great if you could introduce yourself to the ChucK and LiCK community on the ChucK
users mailing list but it is not required. You can just let your code do the talking for you if you like.


### Join the ChucK users mailing list

The primary mechanism for communication between LiCK developers and users is the ChucK users mailing list,
see https://lists.cs.princeton.edu/mailman/listinfo/chuck-users for details.


### Search the Github issue tracker and pull requests

Before creating a new issue, please search the [LiCK issue tracker](https://github.com/heuermh/lick/issues)
and [LiCK open pull requests](https://github.com/heuermh/lick/pulls) on Github.


### Create a new issue on Github

If you have identified a new issue, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/heuermh/lick/issues/new)
on the LiCK issue tracker on Github and prepare supporting material, such as examples, test cases, or sounds that
provide context for your issue.  The [How to submit a contribution](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
Open Source Guide is very helpful in this regard.


### Submit your pull request

Github provides a nice [overview on how to create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

Some general rules to follow:

* Do your work in [a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) of the LiCK repo.
* Create a branch for each feature/bug in LiCK that you're working on. These branches are often called "feature"
or "topic" branches.
* Use your feature branch in the pull request. Any changes that you push to your feature branch will automatically
be shown in the pull request.  If your feature branch is not based off the latest master, you will be asked to rebase
it before it is merged. This ensures that the commit history is linear, which makes the commit history easier to read.
* Include an example or examples if possible.  It is easiest to learn what code does by listening to it make some noise!

We appreciate your contribution to LiCK!
